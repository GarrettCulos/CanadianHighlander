There was but a single cloud last Monday. Fair creature based aggressive decks and combo tilted control decks made up the majority of field. This weeks finals pitted Spencer's 4-color blood (four color not blue) against Stefan's no-win-con Esper control. Looking to beat these two players bring out your bloodmoons and your back to basics, as each deck has three and fifteen basics respectively.
